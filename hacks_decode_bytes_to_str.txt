Problem: I want to know how to convert an element of a list made of bytes to a string

Solution: Select the element you want to convert and decode it using 'utf-8'

Example:

lst_bytes = dct[b'filenames'] # lst_bytes contains elements made of bytes
print(lst_bytes[0]) # b'cool_truck.png'
lst_bytes[0] = lst_bytes[0].decode('utf-8')
print(lst_bytes[0]) # 'cool_truck.png'
