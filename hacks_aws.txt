Question: Do I need to have a prefix (a.k.a) subfolder created inside a s3 bucket before uploading a file to s3?

Answer: No! This answer from stackoverflow is quite awesome:

S3 is an object storage, it has been designed as a Key-Value store where the key is the full name of the file and the content of the file is the Object.

However, for the sake of organizational simplicity, the Amazon S3 console supports the folder concept as a means of grouping objects.
Amazon S3 does this by using a shared name prefix for objects (that is, objects have names that begin with a common string, / by default). Object names are also referred to as key names.

Example with code:

import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
s3.Bucket('autogpe-datasets').upload_file('/tmp/hello.txt', 'txt_files/hello.txt')
