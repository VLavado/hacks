Problem description:

Very ofter I need to keep on searching what is the meaning for each dimension according to data type. I want to have all that info in the same place. So here it goes:

Solution:

features == channels

#####PyTorch Tensors##### 

([batch, channels, height, width])

#####Tensorflow, Numpy#####

([batch, height, width, channels])

#####Pil library (Image) ######

(width, height)

Channels come inside the variable information "RGB Image" for example
