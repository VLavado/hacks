Problem description:

Very ofter I need to search what is the meaning for each dimension according to data type. I want to have all that info in the same place. So here it goes:

Solution:

features == channels

#####PyTorch Tensors##### 

([batch, channels, height, width])

#####Tensorflow, Numpy#####

([batch, height, width, channels])

#####OpenCV#####

When using cv2.imread the image comes in the same format as a numpy array

(height, width, channels)


#####Pil library (Image), scikit-image, matplotlib ######

(width, height)

Channels come inside the variable information "RGB Image" for example

##### scikit-image, matplotlib ######

(channels, width, height)


##### rasterio ######

THe interpretation of a 3-dimension array read from rasterio is:

(bands, rows, columns)

Which can be interpreted as the following equivalent:

(channels, height, width)
