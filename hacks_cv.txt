Problem: What the HECK is hard negative mining or simple hard negative in the context of classifiers?

Solution: Let's say I give you a bunch of images that contain one or more people, and I give you bounding boxes for each one. Your classifier will need both positive training examples (person) and
negative training examples (not person).

For each person, you create a positive training example by looking inside the bounding box. But how do you create useful negative examples?

A good way to start is to generate a bunch of random bounding boxes, and for each that doesn't overlap with any of your positives, keep the new box as a negative.

Ok, so you have positives and negatives, so you train a classifier, and to test it out, you run it on your training images again with a sliding window. But it turns out that your classifier isn't
very good, because it throws a bunch of false positives (people detected where there aren't actually people).

A hard negative is when you take that falsely detected patch, and explicitly create a negative example out of that patch, and add that negative to your training set. When you retrain your classifier,
it should perform better with this extra knowledge.

Problem: What the HECK is objectness in the concept of object detection (with YOLO)?

Solution: It is the network's confidence that some object exists in a given box.  
While the class score is the conditional probability, given that there is an object in the box (i.e. probability of class x given an object exist in this box).

Therefore, the total confidence score for each class is thus the product of the objectness and the class score.

Problem: What the HECK is a mosaic data transformation in the context of training YOLO? How can it affect training with satellite images?

Mosaic data transformation consists on combining 4 pictures into a big picture. During the training (not in validation set) of YOLOv5, this data transformation takes the corresponding index and
adds three more random indexes to generate the mosaic.

For the specific case of oil tank detection mosaic might not be the best option considering the tank sizes for the labes are quite small. So if you resize each individual image to become a quarter
of the mosaic's size then it would be even harder for the network to detect those tanks. As always, with deep learning it is good idea to start with simpler experiment configurations and then start
move up to more complex settigs: e.g. bigger neural networks and
