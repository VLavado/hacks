Problem: How the HECK do you avoid overwriting between existing java versions?

Solution: Don't worry, "apt-get" used to install versions of java version won't overwrite them.

You can switch between installed java versions, use the update-java-alternatives command.

$update-java-alternatives --list

Set a certain java version as default (needs root permissions)

$sudo update-java-alternatives --set /path/to/java/version

...where /path/to/java/version is one of those listed by the previous command (e.g. /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64).
