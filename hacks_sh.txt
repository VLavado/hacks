Problem: what the fuck does "|" mean in a shell script?

Solution: | is called a pipe, and it allows to concatenate operations from left to right.

The syntax is something like:

command1 | command2 | command3 ...

Some examples:

ls -la | grep under

list all files and then filter those that have under in its name

aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${NONPROD_ECR}

login to aws ecr and then use the string response you get to login in docker hub

${NONPROD_ECR} is just an enviromental vairable defined before to point to the repository where our Docker images are stored

Problem: How the fuck do you implement a symlink a.k.a. soft symbolic link a.k.a acceso directo entre dos archivos/carpetas?

Solution: Easy bro

The syntax is simple:

ln [-sf] [source] [destination]

By default, the ln command creates a hard link.
Use the -s option to create a soft (symbolic) link.
The -f option will force the command to overwrite a file that already exists.
Source is the file or directory being linked to.
Destination is the location to save the link â€“ if this is left blank, the symlink is stored in the current working directory.


Some examples:


To create a symlink between to folders:

$ln -s /media/victor/851aa2dd-6b93-4a57-8100-b5253aa4eedd/SAR/Etna_example sar_data

To create a symlink between files: 
$ln -s /media/victor/851aa2dd-6b93-4a57-8100-b5253aa4eedd/SAR/Etna_example/source_file.txt sar_data/destination_file.txt

Problem: How the HECK do I search for a directory (a.k.a folder) on linux?


Solution: You can use find command. To do it you have to be positioned on the parent directory where you think the directory will be:
