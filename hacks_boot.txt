Problem: What happens when you get the message "Tienes poca memoria en /boot"? Is it the end of the world? 

Solution: Not at all! This probable means that you have installed many kernels while updating the software of your machine.

To check if that's the case:

1) If you don't have it yet go and install synaptic: sudo apt-get install synaptic
2) Launch it: sudo synaptic
3) Click on the search icon and type: linux-image  // Here you should see many packages with a green box on the left meaning you have installed them. The ones we are interested in have a description on the left saying something like "signed kernel image generic"
4) On another terminal type: uname -a //This will display the kernel you are actually using. The rest of the kernels with the green box can be "safely uninstalled" 
5) Click right with your mouse on those kernels you want to uninstall where it says "Marcar para desinstalar completamente"
6) You will get a dialog box. Check that you are really uninstalling what you want and then click "aplicar".
7) Enjoy a happy life :)
